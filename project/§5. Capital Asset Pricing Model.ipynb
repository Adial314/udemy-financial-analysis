    "# Capital Asset Pricing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between risk and return is clear (see ยง4), but the specific uses for the diversifiable risk (see ยง2) for determining the value of a security for an investor is remains opaque. In the following section, we will explore how assets can be priced according to their expected risk/return relationship. This system of pricing is know as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Using our understanding of CAPM, we can build portfolios which cater to the needs of clients who are willing to accept differing levels of risk.\n",

    "Under the CAPM landscape, investors are risk-averse, prefer higher returns, and are willing to buy the optimal portfolio for their needs. Realistically, investors are not always so rational, but CAPM operates under this assumption. Sharpe, the economist who invented CAPM, consideres a portfolio which represent alls possible investments throughout the global market place. Such a portfolio contains almost no idiosyncratic risk as it reflects the market perfectly. However, it assumes an asset which has a rate of return without any risk, which some investors would be willing to accept instead of placing investments market-wide. Using this risk-free rate of return, we can find that the Market portfolio investors should accept is the portfolio which represents the intersection of the efficient frontier and the capital market line, which is determined by the risk free rate of return.\n",

    "Using CAPM, we can find an expected return of a security that is more robust than simply using the historical patterns. We can find this CAPM expectation for a given security using the risk-free rate of return at the time of investment combined with the beta of the security distributed to the return of the market minus the risk free rate of return.\n",

    "There is no such thing as a risk free asset, of course, but the closest instrument we can use is the 10-year US government bond. We can use the [US Treasury tables](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) to find this value. As we can see from the historical patterns of the 10-year government bond yield, the average rate of return is approximately 2.5%. The difference between the market return and the risk-ree rate of return is known as the *Equity Risk Premium* and it fluctuates between 4.5% and 5.5%. Given this range, we use 5% to approximate the Equity Risk Premium.\n",

    "Before we can apply this theory, however, we must first understand beta as a measurement of comparative volatility and then we can apply the CAPM formula."
